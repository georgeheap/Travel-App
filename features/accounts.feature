Feature: A user creates an account
  As an unregistered user, I should be able to register for an account


  # @poltergeist
  # Scenario: A user is required to create a username when registering for the site
  #   When I navigate to "/users/sign_up"
  #   Then I should see the "Username" input form
  #     And I should be required to fill in "user_username" with a "Username" when registering
